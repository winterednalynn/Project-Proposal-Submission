Introduction:
•	Provide context and motivations of the project.

o	Why did you decide to work on this project?

I’ve worked in clinics where an electronic clock in/out was not used. The employers relied on employees to write it down / place it in a spreadsheet. It’s a great honor system but I also worked in a work environment were scanning your photo clocks an employee in and out. The technology is amazing and obtaining knowledge of what goes behind the scenes would be a great learning experience and knowledge enhancement. 
o	What are your goals for this project?
❄️ Get familiar with new and popular libraries that implement face detection. 
❄️ Investigate approaches for drawing out and observing facial features like face marks, structures, and particular descriptors utilized for recognition. 
❄️Grasp an understanding in regards to image processing techniques. 
❄️Analysis of Eigen faces & Fisher faces, basically the measure of facial metrics. 
❄️I never done a facial recognition project, so it be interesting what debugging & coding troubles I may run into. With issues like 
this, I goal to be patient with myself and figure out the errors. 

•	What do your project your final project will look like?
o	What are the specific features you deem required to implement for this project?

I vision for business aesthetic website with a heading of the name of the company. 
An intro page that request for the image to be scan and an auto generated message that approves the image and prompts a clock in. 
Same goes for clocking out. 

o	What are features that you would like to implement if given the time?

User registration, creating new employees and placing new images so the system can recognize face. 
Or 
Error logging, when an image is not recognized, an auto response to HR will be alerted. 

•	(Pre-project)
o	How difficult do you think this project will be?

Difficult, I haven’t really done any facial recognition project or made familiar with any of the libraries. I am stepping into a whole new world of coding, and I am hoping this will help me further along my knowledge. 

o	What skills do you plan to develop with this project that will be useful for your job search?

Learning how to do research & where to start, especially with something so foreign.
Adopt a growth in mindset with learning brand new techniques in technology. 
Develop critical thinking skills to take different approaches and problem solve. 

o	What is the industry like for this kind of application (such as mobile application, web development, data analysis, etc.)?
Professional Establishments. 

Process Overview:
•	Mention tools and artifacts used, such as version control and task managers.
o	Languages
*Python
* C#
* 
o	Frameworks (im still working on this to determined best fit) 
*Considering TensorFlow & Keras, PyTorch, and Django

o	Libraries
Face-API.js 
Emgu CV 
Pillow 
OpenCV 

o	Version Control
Github

o	Systems you will deploy on (VR, Web, Mobile (Specifically Mac or Windows), Cross-Platform, etc.)
Windows
Web 
PC 

•	Resources that you have found that you will use ( This isn't set in stone )
o	Websites
https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/blob/master/face_recognition/face_recognition_cli.py
https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/face-detection-python-opencv
o	Books
o	YouTube Videos

•	Explain team roles and procedures.
o	If working with someone else, what are the roles you both plan to have?
o	What features and functions will you both plan to work on?

	This should be an equal distribution of responsibility. I will be grading per individual and if someone is pulling the weight of the other, I will grade accordingly. Also, reach out to me if this appears to be an issue.
Requirements:
•	What are the features that you plan to implement?
o	Note: Reach out to me if you need help defining what kind of features you would like to implement, how to achieve them, and if they are robust enough for this class.
o	Note: I will reach out to you if your project needs to be expanded upon. This is meant to be a showcase of skills and something to demonstrate at an interview.
Project Timeline:
•	Provide a timeline overview, possibly as a Gantt chart or sequential list of milestones.
o	Map out your idea for weekly project on your project.
	This is just a rough idea of how you plan to implement each feature over the quarter.
	This isn't set in stone. You will find out quickly somethings can be done in 1 day, and others take weeks. But this is a plan for you to try to follow.
	Your will update your weekly progress about this in teams.
•	Describe key phases and interesting details about each phase.
o	Examples for this are (Your big features)
	Combining front end and back end
	Implementing Database
	Learning how to deploy your project online
	Implementing your control system in your game
	etc.
Future Work:
•	Discuss potential new features or improvements for future versions.
o	What are features that you would like to implement, but are beyond the 3-month mark?
•	Address any originally planned features not implemented and reasons behind it.
